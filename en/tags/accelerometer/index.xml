        <description>The story I have to say, this is (and I just realized a couple of weeks ago) my longest lived project without being deprecated/abandoned. By the time of this publication, It&amp;rsquo;s been already 3 years in the making. Why? well, mostly because of 3 things
It went though several reimplementations It is a part-time, hobby project which involves hardware and I burnt a display in the process. That alone sends it to the bottom of the hobby projects triage I did wrong some stuff and learned how to it right (or at least differently) during that time When I was younger I had a magic 8 ball and it was one of my favorite toys, the notion of having a pseudorandom assistance was quirky and the toy&amp;rsquo;s presentation itself has its mystique.</description>
